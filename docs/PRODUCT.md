# Bookler — Product Backlog

## Vision

Bookler is a booking platform that allows establishments (salons, clinics, studios, etc.) to manage and offer their services online. Customers can discover services, check availability, and make reservations. Establishments control their resources (employees, rooms), schedules, and services.

---

## Domain Model

### Core Entities

| Entity | Description |
|---|---|
| **User** | A person with an account. Can be an owner or a customer. |
| **Establishment** | A business that offers bookable services. Belongs to a User (owner). |
| **Service** | Something an establishment offers (e.g., "60-min massage"). Has a name, description, and fixed duration (in minutes). |
| **Resource** | A bookable asset required to deliver a service — either an **employee** or a **room/space**. Belongs to an establishment. |
| **Schedule** | Defines the regular working hours for a resource (days of week + time range). |
| **Booking** | A reservation made by a customer for a specific service, resource, and time slot. |
| **Customer** | A user who makes bookings. |

### Relationships

```
User (owner)
  └── Establishment
        ├── Service (offered by establishment)
        │     └── Resource (required to deliver it)
        └── Resource
              └── Schedule (regular availability)

User (customer) ──► Booking ──► Service + Resource + time slot
```

### Key Rules

- A service has a fixed duration. Bookings are duration-length slots.
- A resource can only be in one booking at a time (no overlaps).
- A resource's availability is derived from its schedule minus existing bookings.
- An establishment must have at least one resource and one service before accepting bookings.

## Architectural Decisions

These decisions are fixed for the current phase of development and inform how features are built.

| Decision | Choice | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| **Entity IDs** | Two-field identity: internal UUID (`id`, UUIDv7 generated in domain) + short alphanumeric public code (`code`, nanoid(10) generated in domain). APIs expose only the `code` as the public `id`. | Keeps public IDs opaque and stable; internal UUIDs never surface in API responses. |
| **Scoping** | Services, Resources, and Schedules belong to an Establishment | All reads and writes must be scoped to an `establishmentId`. |
| **API route nesting** | `GET /establishments/:id/services`, not `GET /services` | Prevents cross-establishment data leakage and aligns with the ownership model. |
| **Domain ↔ DB mapping** | `ServiceEntity.create()` for new (unperisted) entities; `reconstruct()` for DB-sourced ones | Keeps UUIDs and DB IDs from ever getting mixed up. |
| **Auth strategy** | OAuth2 with Google + Apple (no email/password) | No secret management burden; users authenticate via trusted providers. |
| **Token format** | JWT signed by server after OAuth callback | Stateless auth; server issues short-lived JWT after successful OAuth exchange. |
| **Authorization model** | Owners own establishments. 403 on ownership violation | Explicit forbidden response (vs hiding existence). |
| **Public endpoints** | `GET /establishments/:code`, `GET /establishments/:code/resources`, `GET /establishments/:code/services` are public | Customers must discover establishments and services without logging in. |

---

## Development Sequence

Features must be built in this order because of data dependency: you cannot scope a Service to an Establishment that doesn't exist yet, and you cannot enforce ownership without auth.

```
0. Authentication & Authorization (Epic 0) — MVP prerequisite
1. Establishment CRUD (Epic 2)
2. Service CRUD — scoped to establishment (Epic 1, revised)
3. Resource CRUD — scoped to establishment (Epic 3)
4. Schedule / Availability (Epic 4)
5. Booking (Epic 5)
```

---

## MVP Scope

The MVP delivers a functional end-to-end flow: an owner sets up an establishment with services and resources, and a customer can book a service.

---

## Epics & Features

---

## Post-MVP Ideas

These are out of scope for the MVP but can be prioritized in future iterations.

- **Customer profiles** — Dedicated customer entity with booking history.
- **Notifications** — Email/SMS reminders for upcoming bookings.
- **Recurring schedules** — Block recurring time off for resources.
- **Multi-resource services** — Services that require more than one resource simultaneously (e.g., room + employee).
- **Pricing** — Services have a price; bookings generate an invoice.
- **Waitlist** — Customers can join a waitlist when no slots are available.
- **Ratings & Reviews** — Customers rate completed bookings.
